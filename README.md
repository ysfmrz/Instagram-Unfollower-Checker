# Instagram Unfollower Checker

A Python script to track Instagram followers and detect unfollowers using Selenium and Firefox.

## Features
- **Create Follower File (F)**: Saves the current list of followers to `followers.txt`.
- **Check Unfollowers (C)**: Compares current followers with the saved list to find unfollowers.

## Prerequisites
- **Firefox**: Must be installed and closed before running.
- **Python 3.x**: Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install selenium

 Geckodriver: Download from here and add to PATH.
 Firefox Profile: Log in to Instagram manually in Firefox once to save your credentials.

Setup:
    Clone the Repository:
    
    bash

    git clone https://github.com/ysfmrz/Instagram-Unfollower-Checker.git
    cd Instagram-Unfollower-Checker

Usage:
    Before running the script, open Firefox, go to your Instagram profile, log in manually, and then close Firefox. This ensures the script uses your logged-in session.
    Run the script:
    
    bash

    python instagram_unfollower_checker.py

   Choose an option:
        F: Create a new follower list.
        C: Check for unfollowers.
    Firefox opens and loads Instagram:
        If itâ€™s slow, press Ctrl+Shift+R to refresh.
        Click "Followers" and scroll manually to the last follower.
    Return to the console and press Enter:
        For F: Saves followers to followers.txt.
        For C: Shows unfollowers and asks if you want to update the file (y/n).
